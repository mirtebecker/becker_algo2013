Work for MFA D+T's Algorithmic Animation class, Fall 2013, taught by @cwhitney.

Week 1
--------------
- Speeds - exploration of perceptible speeds in animation.
- ClickAtoB - change point A or point B of an animation with mouse.
- Multiple Xenos - series of xeno objects following the mouse.

Week 2
--------------
- Videos - analyzation of the motion of three videos.
- Multiple Xeno Vectors - last weeks code with Vectors in stead of ofPoints.
- Trails - playing around with trails.
- Bouncing Ball 3D - 3D version of inclass code of bouncing ball.

Week 3
--------------
- Snake - create a creature using atan2 and sin/cos. The atan2 gives the snake a very unnatural feel, needs some work.
- Double Helix - sin/cos to emulate natural phenomenon. Still work in progress.
- Fort Knox - composition based on a piece of music, 'Fort Knox' by Goldfish. Sort of turned into an exploration of FFT in openFrameworks. The first 30 seconds are probably most interesting.
- Whitney - composition inspired by John Whitney.

Week 4
--------------
- Snake - Processing version of the creature assignment from last week. Atan2 doesn't work yet, not sure why.

Week 5
--------------
