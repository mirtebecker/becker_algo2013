Work for MFA D+T's Algorithmic Animation class, Fall 2013, taught by @cwhitney.
--------------

**Week 2**
- Speeds - exploration of perceptible speeds in animation.
- ClickAtoB - change point A or point B of an animation with mouse.
- Multiple Xenos - series of xeno objects following the mouse.

**Week 3**
- Videos - analyzation of the motion of three videos.
- Multiple Xeno Vectors - last weeks code with Vectors in stead of ofPoints.
- Trails - playing around with trails.
- Bouncing Ball 3D - 3D version of inclass code of bouncing ball.

**Week 4**
- Snake - create a creature using atan2 and sin/cos. The atan2 gives the snake a very unnatural feel, needs some work.
- Double Helix - sin/cos to emulate natural phenomenon. Understanding ofEasyCam become a big thing for this assignment. Still work in progress. 
- Fort Knox - composition based on a piece of music, 'Fort Knox' by Goldfish. Sort of turned into an exploration of FFT in openFrameworks. The first 30 seconds are cool, after that it's less dynamic.
- Whitney - composition inspired by the animations of John Whitney.

**Week 5**
- Snake - Processing version of the creature assignment from last week. Atan2 doesn't work yet, not sure why.
- Fireworks - Still in progress.

**Week 6**
- Particle Sin Cos - a particle system using sine and cosine and three adjustable parameters with ofxUI. Making trails with the particles messes up the ofxUI box, fixed with ofRect, not a very elegant solution. 
- Particle Sin Cos with FBO - trying to fix the trails issue when using ofxUI with FBOs, still having big memory issues with this one.
- Understanding FBOs - excercise in understanding FBOs, using code from the openFrameworks fboTrailsExample.
